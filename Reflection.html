                Intro to Software Technology was an enjoyable, intuitive course. It taught me many skills that allowed me to become a well-rounded beginner in computer science. Learning various programming languages and how they interact was challenging in the best way possible, and creating programs with them gave me a deep feeling of joy. Problem-solving in Intro to Software Technology was tough initially, but expressing my creativity in this class makes me look forward to AP Computer Science Principles. <br> <br>
	            Setting up a virtual machine was fun and fruitful because it allows using multiple computers with just one. It was simple to set up and use. Using a virtual machine allowed the use of all sorts of programming languages and paved the way for the rest of the class. <br> <br>
	            Learning HTML and CSS was interesting because a website is just a code document. HTML and CSS are very neatly structured, which makes it simpler to write and find bugs in code. Creating and styling websites was a satisfying experience, and I can't wait to learn more about it. <br> <br>
                By a long shot, my favorite topic in Intro to Software Technology was learning how to code in Python. Learning to make simple programs in Python was a great experience because I learned the fundamentals of all coding languages, such as input, output, if statements, and print specifiers. Again, creating things was fun, and learning Python is certainly a doorway into learning more programming.
